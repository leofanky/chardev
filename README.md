## How to use

You need to install kernel headers. Check your distro manual on how to get them.

Run `make` to build the module.

To insert the module into kernel run `insmod ./chardev.ko`. You need root privileges for that.
To remove module use `rmmod chardev`.

Kernel messages can be accessed with `dmesg`.
